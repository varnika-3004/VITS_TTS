# VITS Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model Training

This repository contains code for training a Text-to-Speech (TTS) model using the VITS architecture. The model is trained using the IndicVoices-R dataset (Sanskrit) for speech synthesis. This model can be adapted for various Indian languages.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

It is recommended to have access to a GPU for faster training, though it is not a strict requirement.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up your environment and begin training:

### 1. Clone the Repositories

Clone the necessary repositories for the VITS implementation and the IndicVoices dataset.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using pip by running the provided commands in your terminal.

### 3. Download the Dataset

Download the IndicVoices dataset (Sanskrit in this case) and extract it to your local machine.

### 4. Process the Audio Files

To process the .wav audio files, you need to resample them to 22,050 Hz for consistency in training. The script provided handles this by reading the .wav files, resampling them, and saving the processed files.

### 5. Configure the Model

The configuration for the TTS model includes specifying the dataset, audio properties, and training parameters such as the batch size, number of epochs, and evaluation settings. You'll also define the character set (e.g., alphabet, digits, and punctuation) and other model-specific parameters.

### 6. Training the Model

Once the environment is set up and the model is configured, you can start the training process. The training will use the IndicVoices dataset and save the model after each epoch.

### 7. Evaluating the Model

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using the evaluation script. This will provide insights into the quality of the speech synthesis generated by the model.

## Notes

- Ensure that the dataset is in the correct format and directory structure for easy processing.
- The model training requires significant computational resources. For best results, a machine with a GPU is recommended.
- The IndicVoices dataset is used in this example, but the configuration can be adapted for other datasets and languages.
